## Getting Started

Install all dependencies
``` bash
npm i
```

Run locally with hot reloading

```

Run locally as static production build (Requires serve dependency)
``` bash
npm run serve
```

Analyze bundle
``` bash
npm run analyze
```

Remove temporary files and directories
``` bash
npm run clean
```

Lint project files
``` bash
npm run lint
```

Run unit tests
``` bash
npm test
```

Generate unit test coverage report
``` bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Build project files
``` bash
npm run build

## Project Structure

### `/components`

React components which could be reused in multiple pages or are complex enough to move them to another file and test them individually.

### `/lib`

Internal code that can be reused and is not specific to an individual project such as apis, contexts, hooks, middleware, utilities, etc.

### `/pages`

In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

### `/public`

Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called public in the root directory. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/)

### `/scripts`

Miscellaneous scripts used for tooling, automation, deployments, etc.
